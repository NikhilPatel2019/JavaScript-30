    // //FOR NUMBERS
    // let age = 20;
    // let age2 = age;

    //**********==>> Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    //**********==>> and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[2] = 'Luke';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //ANS => Whenever we change the reference variable the variable from which it is refrenced is also changed

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.splice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Chaca Chaudhary',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const leader = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 85});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const leader2 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
